This mod adds 12 new UV related genes, 5 that increase the penalties received while under sunlight, and 7 that give the pawn a bonus while under sunlight that are the reverse of the penalty equivalent. Due to these genes having multiple effects, I have put their effects in a list below. For reference, the vanilla gene Mild UV sensitivity gives Mood -6 and Move Speed 90%, while Intense UV Sensitivity gives Mood -12 and Move Speed 80%.
